Python Bootcamp - The App Brewery
These exercises are from 100 days of Code, Python Bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu -- The App Brewery course on Udemy. 
This course is highly recommended!!  The course offers a wealth of information on Python programming with exercises which allow you to work through various coding challenges. 
The course will certainly take me more than 100 days, but is also giving me the opportunity to work through commont software problems from a number of different angles.
